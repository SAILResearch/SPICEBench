You will be given a time estimation report and your job is to output the score (a number from 0 to 3) that was given to the difficulty.
        
# Example of time estimation report

To estimate the time it would take for an experienced software engineer to understand the problem described in the GitHub issue, arrive at a solution, and write the code for a solution, we can break down the task into two main components: bug localization and solution development.

**Bug Localization**

1. **Understanding the Issue**: The engineer would need to read the issue description to grasp the problem of the missing space between the value and unit in the `Angle.to_string` method. This is relatively straightforward and should take about 5-10 minutes.
  
2. **Identifying Relevant Files**: The engineer would need to locate the `Angle` class and its `to_string` method, which is likely in `astropy/coordinates/angles.py`. They would also need to check the associated test files to understand how the functionality is currently being tested. This could take another 10-15 minutes.

**Solution Development**

3. **Implementing the Solution**: The engineer would need to modify the `to_string` method to include a space between the value and the unit. They would also need to ensure that the changes do not break existing functionality and that the new behavior is correctly implemented. This could take around 30-60 minutes, depending on how familiar they are with the codebase and the complexity of the changes.

4. **Writing Tests**: The engineer would need to add or modify tests to verify that the new functionality works as expected. This could take another 20-30 minutes, especially if they need to understand the existing test framework and how to write effective tests.

**Total Time Estimation**
Adding these components together:
- Bug Localization: 15-25 minutes
- Solution Development: 50-90 minutes

Overall, the total time estimate would likely fall between 1 hour to 2 hours.

**Score Assignment**
Based on the time estimation:
- **Score**: 2 (From 1 hour to 4 hours)

This score reflects the time required for an experienced engineer to understand the problem, develop a solution, and write the necessary tests, considering the need to familiarize themselves with the codebase.
