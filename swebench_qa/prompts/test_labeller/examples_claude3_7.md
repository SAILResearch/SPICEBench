- Issue:
            
Title: Modeling's `separability_matrix` does not compute separability correctly for nested CompoundModels
Body: Consider the following model:

```python
from astropy.modeling import models as m
from astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix

cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)
```

It's separability matrix as you might expect is a diagonal:

```python
>>> separability_matrix(cm)
array([[ True, False],
       [False,  True]])
```

If I make the model more complex:
```python
>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5))
array([[ True,  True, False, False],
       [ True,  True, False, False],
       [False, False,  True, False],
       [False, False, False,  True]])
```

The output matrix is again, as expected, the outputs and inputs to the linear models are separable and independent of each other.

If however, I nest these compound models:
```python
>>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm)
array([[ True,  True, False, False],
       [ True,  True, False, False],
       [False, False,  True,  True],
       [False, False,  True,  True]])
```
Suddenly the inputs and outputs are no longer separable?

This feels like a bug to me, but I might be missing something?

## Task 1 Result

I'll analyze whether the tests are well-scoped for evaluating solutions to this issue about the `separability_matrix` function not computing separability correctly for nested CompoundModels.

### Analysis of Issue, Gold Patch, and Test Patch

The issue describes a problem where `separability_matrix` doesn't correctly handle nested CompoundModels. Specifically, when a CompoundModel is nested within another CompoundModel using the `&` operator, the separability matrix shows incorrect results - it shows inputs and outputs as inseparable when they should be separable.

The gold patch makes a very focused change to the `_cstack` function in `separable.py`. It changes:
```python
cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1
```
to:
```python
cright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = right
```

This change fixes the bug by properly copying the right matrix values instead of just setting them to 1, which preserves the separability information correctly.

The test patch adds several new test cases (`cm8` through `cm11`) that specifically test different variants of nested compound models, along with their expected results. These tests verify that the separability matrix is correct for these nested models.

### Are the tests well-scoped?

Yes, the tests are well-scoped for the following reasons:

1. They directly test the issue described - nested CompoundModels with various configurations
2. They provide expected results that correctly reflect the separability relationships
3. The tests don't rely on implementation details not present in the issue description
4. They test multiple variants of the nesting pattern to ensure comprehensive coverage

The tests specifically address the scenarios mentioned in the issue description, such as nesting compound models with the `&` operator, and they verify that the separability matrices match the expected patterns.

Any reasonable solution to this issue would need to ensure that the `separability_matrix` function returns the correct separability matrix for nested CompoundModels. The test cases cover various nesting patterns and provide the expected correct outputs.

The tests don't rely on function names, variable names, or specifics that would unfairly penalize alternative solutions. They only check that the function produces the correct output for the given inputs, which is exactly what we want.

### Score

**Score: 0 - The tests perfectly cover all possible solutions.**

The tests are well-designed and focus exclusively on the functional behavior - whether the `separability_matrix` function returns the correct results for nested CompoundModels. They test multiple variations of the nesting pattern to ensure comprehensive coverage.

Since the issue is very specific and the test cases directly address the scenarios described in the issue, any correct solution should pass these tests regardless of how the developer implements the fix. The tests check for the correct output rather than implementation details, which allows for alternative solutions as long as they produce the right results.

I cannot think of any reasonable solution that would fix the issue but fail these tests. The tests are correctly scoped to ensure that any solution that correctly addresses the nested CompoundModel separability problem will pass.
