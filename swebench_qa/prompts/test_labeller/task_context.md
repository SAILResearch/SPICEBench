# Task Context
            
Given a new candidate solution, we intend to use the Test Patch to check whether the solution correctly resolves the issue. However, remember that these tests were written with a particular solution in mind (the Gold Patch) so they may be ill-suited for evaluating other valid solutions. We would like to know if the tests are correctly scoped to identify all reasonable solutions to the issue, or if the tests rely on narrow details that would unfairly penalize a new solution that is otherwise correct. In other words, our setup only works if the tests do not rely on any details that are not present in the issue description. We find that the most common problems occur when there are subtle discrepancies between the tests and the issue text, such as the tests relying on a new function, variable name, or error message that were introduced in the Gold Patch but is not mentioned or differs from the Issue Description. Please check carefully for such discrepancies, and remember that the engineer attempting this issue will not have access to the original PR or the tests
