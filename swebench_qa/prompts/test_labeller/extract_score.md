You will be given an assessment report and your job is to output the score (a number from 0 to 3) that was given to tests.
        
# Example assessment report

The tests in the provided Test Patch are not well-scoped enough to ensure that all reasonable solutions to the issue will pass. The issue revolves around the incorrect use of the `replace` method on a `chararray`, which is not an in-place operation. The Gold Patch addresses this by modifying the code to use in-place assignment with slicing.

- Rationale:
1. **Test Coverage**: The tests primarily focus on verifying the checksum and data integrity of FITS files, but they do not directly test the specific behavior of the `replace` method in the context of the issue. The tests check for specific checksum values and data formats, which may not adequately cover the logic change introduced in the Gold Patch.

2. **Specificity of Tests**: The tests rely on specific checksum values that are tied to the original implementation. If a new solution modifies the logic in a way that still resolves the issue but results in different checksum values, the tests will fail. This indicates that the tests are too narrow and depend on specific implementation details rather than the broader functionality.

3. **Potential Solutions**: A reasonable solution could involve different methods of handling the replacement of characters in the output field that do not rely on the specific implementation of the `replace` method. If such a solution were implemented, it might not pass the tests due to the reliance on specific checksum values.

- Score:
Given these points, I would assign the tests a score of **2**. This indicates that while the tests work for the original solution, they may miss some perfectly reasonable solutions that address the issue but do not conform to the specific implementation details expected by the tests.
